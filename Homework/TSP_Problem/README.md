## Reference
The codes is not 100% originaly written by me, I took reference and had done some modification to the code in [towardsdatascience.com](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-implement-the-hill-climbing-algorithm-in-python-1c65c29469de). 


The data in [tsp_d.txt](./tsp_d.txt) was originaly from this website [people.sc.fsu.edu](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/tsp/tsp.html).
